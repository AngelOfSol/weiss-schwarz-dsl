top-level patterns are different from normal code

no function name overloading

(symbol args...)
`x -> (quote x)
x.y.z[0] -> (index (get (get x y) z) 0)
// type check the above?

_ -> unbound pattern matcher

(def (fun-name (type variable-name) (type _)))

(filter array (item) (...))

(for-each (x: T in y: [T])
	(print x)
)
(
	(print "1")
	(print "2")
	(print "3")
)
==
(seq
	(print "1")

ask mason about opinions on dealing with scoping issues vs lambdas

maybe just go functional style?
this might work best because functions have arguments?
consider tuple types?
(let (x 5)
	(print x)
)

x.y -> (get y x)

(trigger move
	(card: Card to: Zone) -> (from: Zone)
	(if 
		(and
			(eq card.owner (opponent self.owner))
			(eq from.zone clock)
			(eq to.zone waiting-room)
		)
		(let cost (match
				(choice [`yes, `no] card.owner)
				(`yes 
					(repeat 2 
						(move (top-of card.owner.stock) waiting-room)
					)
				)
				(`no [])
			)
			(if (neq 2 (len cost))
				(move (top-of card.owner.deck) clock)
			)
		)
	)
)

(move card zone) -> zone



change code gen so that anonymous functions get inlined?, but defines don't
still need to figure out how to pass a fn to a rust function and have it run
